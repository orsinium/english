## Agree

|         | positive          | negative              |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Phrase  | I'm happy.        | I'm not happy.        |
| Short   | So am I.          | Neither am I.         |
| Full    | I'm happy too.    | I'm not happy either. |

If it is necessary use `do`, `have`, `can` etc. instead of `am`

How to disagree? You can say "But I'm not". However in most cases it's a little bit rude, I guess.


## Possibility

| Word    | %     |
|---------|-------|
| Must    | 100%  |
| Should  | 75%   |
| Can     | 50%   |
| May     | 40%   |
| Might   | 30%   |
| Could   | 20%   |
| Cannot  | 0%    |

Possibility words follows in that order, but I'm not sure about this values.


## Quantifiers

| countable   | uncountable |
|-------------|-------------|
| too many    | too much    |
| a few       | a little    |

* **many/much**
  * I have **too much** work.
  * I eat **too many** cakes.
  * I'm **too** tired.
* **enough**
  * I don't drink **enough** water.
  * This dress isn't big **enough**.
* **some**
* **a few / a little**
  * I eat **a little** meat.
  * I bought **a few** bananas.
* **no**
  * **no** milk.
  * **no** books.

How to choose, countable or uncountable? Countable words have a plural form. Uncountable don't have it. That's all.

For both, countable and uncountable:

* **Enough**
* **A lot of**, **lots of**. Prefer it to `much` in positive sentences:
  * We **didn't** spend **much** money.
  * We spent **a lot of** money.
* **Plenty of**. It's more than enough.


**Little** and **few** (without a) are negative ideas (= not much / not many):
  * He spoke **little** English, so it was difficult to communicate with him.
  * He spoke **a little** English, so we were able to communicate with him.
